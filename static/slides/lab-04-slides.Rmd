## Team name + agreement

- Come up with a team name. You can't have the same name as another group in the class, so be creative! 
  - Your TA will get your team name by the end of lab.

- Fill out the team agreement. The goals of the agreement are to...
  - Gain a common understanding of the team's goals and expectations for collaboration
  - Make a plan for team communication
  - Make a plan for working outside of lab.

## Tips for working on a team

- Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

- The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.

- Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.

## Team workflow 

- Only one team member should type at a time. There are markers in today's lab to help you determine who's turn it is to type. 

  - Every team member should still be engaged in discussion for all questions, even if it's not your turn type. 
  
- Don't forget to **pull** to get your teammates' updates before making changes to the .Rmd file 

- Only **one** submission for the team on Gradescope.
