# Data Science


---

## What is data science?

- Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.

- We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

---

## Course FAQ

**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**
A - While statistics $\neq$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is not your typical high school statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**
A - Yes. We will use the computing language R.
